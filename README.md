- Website: https://mopsfl.de/GoofyLuaUglifier/ 
- API: https://docs.mopsfl.de

## What is this?
**GoofyLuaUglifier** is a personal project I’ve been working on in my free time for a while. I created it to learn more about Lua obfuscation and the techniques behind it. Over time, it has grown with many features, and have decided to make it publicly available for everyone! The core source code is not public tho.

## Features
- Uglifies Lua code (minification + simple obfuscation)
- Web UI for quick tests
- HTTP API for automation / integrations
